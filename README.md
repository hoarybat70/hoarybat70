ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hoarybat70! 

Hoary Bats are a species of bat in the vesper bat family called vespertillionidae that live throughout most parts of North America and Hawaii.

Here's a basic morphology lesson for vespertillionidae, and more importantly the diction of vesper.

	- Vesper as a noun means "evening prayer;" it's archaic meaning stands for evening, and it's literary meaning is venus as the evening star. 
	- For being a species of bat, it's no wonder that it's very root stands in the night. Interesting, right? 

I'm hoping to create a website with some games online that other people at school can use and play during their study halls and free times! (Just... don't do it in class please. Playing games in study hall or at home or on the bus increases the likelihood of this website staying up and is more correct morally.) :D

Comment in this video link whatever NES, SNES, or GBA games you're hoping to play next and I'll try to add them!
